# learnReact
At first, this repo was created for myself to practise React. During the process, I learned a lot from building this App. So I want to make this app better and better. And also, I hope to write articles about my thoughts. So I would like to make this the first formal App by myself. Anyone who want to join can fork my repo and pull request. I will keep building this App.
